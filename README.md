## DeepSea Labs

Welcome to **DeepSea Labs** ([https://deepsealabs.co](https://deepsealabs.co)), an open-source collective dedicated to building the best tools for underwater exploration, data analysis, and community sharing. We believe that diving should be accessible, fun, and data-driven—and our mission is to empower researchers, developers, and hobbyists with modular, high-quality software components you can trust and extend.

### Our Mission

* **Democratize Dive Technology**: Lower barriers to entry by publishing open‑core engines, SDKs, and libraries for dive logging, color correction, real‑time telemetry, and more.
* **Foster Collaboration**: Bring together a global community of divers, scientists, and developers to co-create and maintain projects that benefit everyone.
* **Advance Underwater Research**: Provide tools and datasets that enable new discoveries in marine biology, oceanography, and diving safety.

### What We Do

1. **Open-Source Libraries**

   * **LibDC-Swift**: Swift bindings for libdivecomputer over BLE, with support for Suunto and Shearwater, efficient fingerprint syncing, and dive log parsing.
   * **FIT Parser Swift**: A Swift package to parse FIT 21.141.0 dive files, including session metadata and tank summaries, with SwiftUI and CLI tools.

2. **Reference Apps & SDKs**

   * Currents (proprietary): social dive‑logging platform (formerly DiverPlus)
   * Underwater: color correction toolkit for macOS/iOS, supporting RAW and 4K–8K video, batch processing, and automatic color correction

3. **Community & Education**

   * Sample datasets (open dive logs)
   * Public issue trackers and feature roadmaps
